    "# 1. Filtering by Year: Think about how you can use conditional statements to filter the data by year levels (Year 9, 10, 11, and 12). \n",

    "# 2. Grouping by School: Consider using a function that allows you to group data by specific criteria. \n",
    "#    In this case, you will need to group the filtered data by the school name and then calculate the mean for the math scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Creating Series for Each Year Level: Repeat the above steps for each year level, resulting in four different Series, each containing the mean math scores by school for that year level.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Combining the Series into a DataFrame: Investigate how to create a DataFrame from existing Series. \n",
    "#    You will need to combine the four Series you created into a single DataFrame with appropriate column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Data Wrangling: Look into how you can reorder columns in a DataFrame. \n",
    "#    This step will ensure the columns are in the correct order (Year 9, Year 10, Year 11, Year 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Cleaning Up Index Name: Research how to modify the index name of a DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Displaying the Final DataFrame: Finally, explore how to display or print the resulting DataFrame in the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Debugging and Iteration: If you encounter issues, use print statements to understand what's happening at each step, and don't hesitate to iterate and improve upon your code."
